        <p>As someone who used a lot of high-level languages, Rust was kinda surprising in its approach to memory
            management and performance.
            I can't lie, Rust is really hard to understand. I had to read a lot of documentation and watch a lot of
            videos to understand how it works,
            and even then, I still have a lot to learn.
        </p>
        <p>Given that I'm following engineering studies, I've decided to apply what I've learned this year with Rust (my
            school is using Python instead, but this is too easy)</p>
        <h2>My first Rust project: implementing Linear Algebra</h2>
        <p>Title explains all. My goal here is to implement a simple linear algebra library in Rust, including :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vector spaces and subspaces</li>
            <li>Linear independence and spanning families</li>
            <li>Basis and dimensions</li>
            <li>Rank theorem</li>
            <li>Row echelon form</li>
            <li>Matrix inversion</li>
            <li>Linear maps and transformations</li>
            <li>Kernel and image</li>
            <li>Polynomials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Currently, I'm implementing Gaussian elimination, and matrix inversion. I'm planning to extend it with
            determinant calculation, so I'll update this as I progress.</p>
        <h3>Matrix</h3>
        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p>First of all, let's define the <Latex :displayMode="false">A_{i,j}</Latex> Matrix with <Latex
                :displayMode="false">\{(i, j) \in \{1, \dots, n\}^2 \mid i = j\}</Latex>. We admit that <Latex
                :displayMode="false">i = j</Latex> to simplify the notation :</p>
        <Latex
            :displayMode="true">A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1j} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2j} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{i1} & a_{i2} & \cdots & a_{ij} \end{pmatrix}</Latex>
        <p>Implementing a vector of a vector is not straightforward in Rust : so I'm using a flat vector
            <code>Vec&lt;f64&gt;</code> instead to represent it.</p>
        <p>Thus, the matrix is represented as a flat vector of size <Latex :displayMode="false">m</Latex>, enough to
            store a square matrix in a single vector.</p>
        <p>I needed then to establish a mapping between the 2D indices and the 1D index in the flat vector, so I
            converted the 2D indices to a 1D index using the formula <Latex :displayMode="false">k = i \times n + i
            </Latex>.</p>

        <p>Thus, I created the following <code>struct</code> :</p>
        <CodeBlock language="rust">
            struct Matrix {
            data: Vec&#60;f64&#62;,
            n: usize
            }
        </CodeBlock>
        <p>Take acknowledge that all the functions are implemented inside of the <code>impl Matrix</code> block.</p>

        <h4>Elementary operations</h4>
        <p>Now that I have a matrix, I can implement elementary operations on it. The elementary operations are :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Row swapping</li>
            <li>Row multiplication by a scalar</li>
            <li>Row addition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These operations are implemented as methods of the <code>Matrix</code> struct, and they are used to implement
            the Gaussian elimination algorithm.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I've first of all created a function <code>get_row</code> to retrieve a specific row from the matrix. I
                will use this function to implement the elementary operations.</li>
            <li>The row swapping function (<Latex :displayMode="false">L_1 \longleftrightarrow L_2</Latex>) simply calls
                the <code>get_row</code> function to retrieve two rows and then swaps them.</li>
            <li>The row multiplication by a scalar function (<Latex :displayMode="false">L_i \leftarrow \alpha \cdot L_i
                </Latex>) calls the <code>get_row</code> function to retrieve a row and then multiplies each element by
                the scalar.</li>
            <li>The row addition function (<Latex :displayMode="false">L_i \leftarrow L_i + \alpha L_j</Latex>) calls
                the <code>get_row</code> function to retrieve two rows and then adds them together.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's take an example to illustrate how these operations work. Consider the following matrix:</p>
        <Latex :displayMode="true">A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \end{pmatrix}</Latex>
        <p>We can perform the following operations on this matrix:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Swap the first and second rows:</li>
            <Latex :displayMode="true">A \sim \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \end{pmatrix}
                </Latex>
            <li>Multiply the second row by 2:</li>
            <Latex :displayMode="true">A \sim \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 2 & 4 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \end{pmatrix}
                </Latex>
            <li>Add 3 times the first row to the third row:</li>
            <Latex :displayMode="true">A \sim \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 2 & 4 & 6 \\ 19 & 23 & 27 \end{pmatrix}
            </Latex>
        </ul>
        <p>These operations are the building blocks for the Gaussian elimination algorithm, which I will implement soon.
        </p>

            <h3>What do I think?</h3>
            <p>Honestly, Rust is very frustrating when you always used high-level languages. However, I feel like I can
                get used to it with practice, thus progressing.
                Maybe using maths to learn Rust was not the best idea, but I would not have learned it otherwise, and
                practicing like that may improve my maths skills and my programming skills at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>I could've write something more efficient though, but I had no idea how.</p>
